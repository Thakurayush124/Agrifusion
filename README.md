ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³AI-Driven Agricultural SystemðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³
Project Summary
This project aims to enhance agricultural practices using advanced AI techniques. The system integrates four key models to provide comprehensive solutions for farmers, focusing on soil health, plant texture analysis, crop counting, and disease detection. By leveraging video frames and image analysis, the system offers real-time monitoring and insights, helping farmers make informed decisions to optimize crop yield and maintain plant health.

Features
Automated Crop Counting: Uses video frames to accurately count crops, helping monitor plant growth and estimate yield.
Disease Detection: Analyzes plant images to detect signs of diseases, providing early warnings for timely intervention.
Soil Health Assessment: Evaluates soil parameters such as moisture levels, nutrient content, and pH balance to recommend optimal farming practices.
Plant Identification: Builds a database of plant textures to accurately identify various plant species.
Growth Monitoring: Tracks the growth stages of crops over time to optimize harvesting schedules.
Pest Detection: Identifies the presence of pests and insects in crops to enable timely interventions.
Customizable Alerts: Provides alerts and notifications for disease outbreaks, soil health issues, and pest infestations.
Data Visualization: Generates visual reports and dashboards for easy interpretation of soil and crop health data.
Integration with Farming Equipment: Connects with smart farming equipment for automated responses based on AI recommendations.
Historical Data Analysis: Analyzes historical data to predict future trends and improve farming strategies.


Models
Soil Analysis Model: Assesses soil health through various indicators like moisture levels, nutrient content, and pH balance.
Texture Analysis Model: Builds a comprehensive database of plant textures for accurate identification.
Crop Counting Model: Utilizes video frames to detect and count crops, aiding in monitoring plant growth and estimating yield.
Disease Detection Model: Analyzes plant images to detect signs of diseases, providing early warnings for farmers.

  NOTE:- OUR Soil anlaysis and plant counting model are ready and working but due to large size constraints we were not able to push there code and stuff but we can provide you the material in 
  case of need.

  Before accessing the material from the repo you should download the zip or clone it and open it on ypur desired softwares.
